# List Custom Artisan Commands... Command

[![Latest Version on Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/v/jakebathman/list-custom-artisan-commands.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/jakebathman/list-custom-artisan-commands)

This package adds a single command to your Laravel application:

```bash
php artisan commands:custom
```

This provides much the same output as `php artisan list`, but only showing you commands that fall under the application's `App\` namespace. This makes it much easier to see your own commands in an app, instead of your commands all mixed in to the default command set as well.

## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require jakebathman/list-custom-artisan-commands
```
